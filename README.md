FileCryptor: Advanced File Encryption and Decryption
Introduction
FileCryptor is a robust and user-friendly solution for encrypting and decrypting sensitive files, ensuring that your data remains secure from unauthorized access. With the increasing need for data privacy in the digital age, FileCryptor offers an efficient way to protect your files using strong encryption algorithms. This tool is ideal for users who require a simple yet effective method to safeguard their confidential information, whether it's personal documents, business files, or any other sensitive data.

How It Works:

FileCryptor operates through a straightforward process that involves two primary functions: encryption and decryption.
Encryption Process:
The user selects a file to be encrypted.
FileCryptor generates a secure encryption key and applies a strong encryption algorithm to convert the file's contents into an unreadable format.
The encrypted file can only be accessed by decrypting it with the correct key, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot read or alter the contents.

Decryption Process:
The user selects an encrypted file and provides the corresponding decryption key.
FileCryptor uses this key to reverse the encryption process, restoring the file to its original readable format.
This process ensures that only users with the correct key can access the encrypted information, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.

Features:
Strong Encryption: Utilizes industry-standard encryption algorithms to ensure data security.
Ease of Use: Simple interface for both encrypting and decrypting files.
Cross-Platform: Can be used on multiple operating systems with minimal setup.
Secure Key Management: Ensures that encryption keys are handled securely to prevent unauthorized access.

Installation:
To use FileCryptor, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the maincode.py file to get started with encrypting and decrypting your files.
->Copy code
>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FileCryptor.git
>cd FileCryptor
>python maincode.py

Usage:
Encrypt a File: Follow the prompts to select a file and generate an encryption key.
Decrypt a File: Provide the encrypted file and the corresponding key to restore the file to its original state.
